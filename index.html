### The Government of Canada has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to deliver world-class services to Canadians. <b>This will require disruption as we make the switch, both technically and culturally, to agile digital delivery models. To accelerate these efforts, I am excited to announce the launch of the Canadian Digital Service (CDS)</b> to modernize the way the Government of Canada designs and delivers digital services. CDS will be a partner to departments in delivering measurably improved services. <b>We are rethinking the service design and delivery process</b> from the user’s perspective, and engaging users every step of the way. -- the Honourable Scott Brison

### This is an example of a text only slide. Although some people might require more space, it is encouraged to keep it brief and use the 3 line slide template. Keep the text bold  with the < b > tag, line break when necessary < br > and try to stay between 5 or 6 lines.
